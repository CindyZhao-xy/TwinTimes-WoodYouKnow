# TwinTimes-WoodYouKnow Desktop Application

This project has been conducted as a collaborative effort between a team of students from the Computer Engineering Technologyâ€“Computing Science program. This group of students possess specialized knowledge and technical programming skills in creating an interactive desktop application using Electron Framework and JavaScript-based programming language. The desktop software of our team has created will enable the client to precisely manage the woodworking tool resources, which enables classifying the fastest and most convenient catalogue and dividing the hazard levels of woodworking tools. The application will be compatible with Windows operating system and compatible with a future system update.

This desktop application implemented will:
* Allow data entry of an item manually
* Import and export data from Excel or CSV files
* Calculate the cost for a particular tool category
* Produce graphs and reports
* Print all the information related to a specific tool chosen by the client
* Export data to a usable file format such as ASCII TXT format, should the application become unusable due to age
* Be intuitive and easy to operate
* Be compatible with Windows OS and compatible with future OS updates
* Not be rendered obsolete by newer technologies for an extended period of time
* Contain search features to facilitate product information acquisition
* Quickly and accurately retrieve relevant safety and operational information
* Includes all required resources documentation of woodworking in Resources library
* Simplifying and easy to get started with User interface

The scope of this project is as follows: keyword query, produce graphs and reports, display specific item details, sum calculation of item costing, documentation of all woodworking tools description, a listing of woodworking tools, linked pictures, and application guides manual for operators. The application will not include features such as purchase and payment. Interpretation of literature content attributable to the source. The finished application will be given to Mr. Donaldson to address the current issues being faced. This project is not transferred to the public domain and will not be used in any commercial capacity.
